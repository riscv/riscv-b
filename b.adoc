== B Standard Extension for Bit Manipulation Instructions

The B standard extension comprises instructions provided by the Zba, Zbb,
and Zbs extensions.

=== Privileged Architecture Implications

Bit 1 of the `misa` register encodes the presence of the B standard extension.
When `misa.B` is 1, the implementation supports the instructions provided by the
Zba, Zbb, and Zbs extensions. When `misa.B` is 0, it indicates that the
implementation may not support one or more of the Zba, Zbb, or Zbs extensions.
