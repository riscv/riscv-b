= B Standard Extension for Bit Manipulation Instructions

// Preamble
[WARNING]
.This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Frozen state]
====
Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change will
only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during the
public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject of a
follow-on new extension. This draft specification will change before being
accepted as standard, so implementations made to this draft specification will
likely not conform to the future standard.

== B Standard Extension for Bit Manipulation Instructions

The B standard extension comprises instructions provided by the Zba, Zbb,
and Zbs extensions.

=== Privileged Architecture Implications

Bit 1 of the `misa` register encodes the presence of the B standard extension.
When `misa.B` is 1, the implementation supports the instructions provided by the
Zba, Zbb, and Zbs extensions. When `misa.B` is 0, it indicates that the
implementation may not support one or more of the Zba, Zbb, or Zbs extensions.
